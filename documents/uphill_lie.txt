### Uphill Lie
When hitting from an uphill lie:
1. **Setup**:
   - Align your body parallel to the slope, tilting back slightly with your right leg straightened and left leg bent.
   - Match your hips and shoulders to the slope.

2. **Loft Adjustments**:
   - Take one more club (e.g., a 7-iron instead of an 8-iron) as the slope increases loft, launching the ball higher.

3. **Swing**:
   - Maintain a full body turn, allowing the slope to help launch the ball.
   - Avoid fighting against the slope.
