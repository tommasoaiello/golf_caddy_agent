### Ball Above Feet
When the ball is above your feet:
1. **Loft Considerations**:
   - Higher lofted clubs will cause the ball to move further left due to the lie angle.
   - Be mindful of this and adjust your aim accordingly.
   
2. **Setup**:
   - Stand taller and grip down slightly on the club.
   - Aim right of your target to account for the ball curving left.

3. **Swing**:
   - Ensure a full body turn through the shot, avoiding a static arm-only swing.
