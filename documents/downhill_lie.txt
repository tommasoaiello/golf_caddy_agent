### Downhill Lie
When playing from a downhill lie:
1. **Setup**:
   - Align your body parallel to the slope with your left leg bent and right leg straighter.
   - Keep your weight on your left side to maintain balance.

2. **Loft Adjustments**:
   - Take one less club (e.g., an 8-iron instead of a 7-iron) as the slope decreases loft, launching the ball lower.

3. **Swing**:
   - Avoid trying to lift the ball; let the club do the work.
   - Turn your body through the shot without leaning back.
