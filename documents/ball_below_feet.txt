### Ball Below Feet
When the ball is below your feet:
1. **Loft Considerations**:
   - The ball tends to move slightly right but not as drastically as with the ball above your feet.
   - Aim slightly left of the target.

2. **Setup**:
   - Bend your knees more, stick your hips out, and lower your center of gravity.
   - Maintain balance with more weight toward the front of your feet.

3. **Swing**:
   - Focus on balance and make a full body turn.
   - Ensure you stay low to make solid contact with the ball.
