How to Hit Fairway Bunker Shots - A Four-Step Plan

If you're having problems hitting solid shots out of fairway bunkers, follow this four-step plan to improve your technique and results:

1. Bury Your Feet
   - Dig your feet slightly into the sand to improve balance on the soft surface.
   - Roll your feet inward to keep your weight centered between your ankles.

2. Choke Down on the Club
   - Grip the club about an inch lower, which compensates for the depth of your feet in the sand.

3. Focus on Ball-First Contact
   - Look at the top or the front of the ball to ensure the club makes contact with the ball before the sand.

4. Use a Three-Quarter Swing
   - Keep your swing compact and controlled with a smooth three-quarter motion to maintain balance.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a better chance of hitting solid shots and getting out of fairway bunkers successfully.
