How to Hit from the Rough - Key Adjustments for Success

Finding your ball in the rough is a common occurrence in golf, and the way you approach the shot can make all the difference. Here’s a guide to executing this shot effectively:

1. **Grip the Club Slightly Open**
   - Open the clubface slightly before gripping it. This helps counteract the tendency of the grass to grab the heel of the club, which can cause pulls or hooks.
   - Opening the face also adds loft, which is essential for this type of shot.

2. **Ball Position and Stance**
   - Move the ball slightly back in your stance. This adjustment helps you make contact with the ball first, avoiding interference from the grass.
   - Stand closer to the ball to steepen your swing path, enabling cleaner contact.

3. **Club Selection**
   - Consider using one club more than usual to compensate for the lower trajectory. For instance, if you’d normally use a 7-iron, opt for a 6-iron.

4. **Weight Distribution**
   - Set your weight slightly forward on your lead leg (left leg for right-handed golfers). This promotes a steeper angle of attack and helps flight the ball lower.

5. **Grip Down and Narrow Stance**
   - Grip down on the club slightly. Combined with standing closer to the ball, this creates a more controlled, narrow swing.

6. **Swing Path**
   - Aim to swing slightly outside the line. This helps maintain control and improves the chance of solid contact.

**Key Thought Process:**
- The goal is to make ball-first contact, ensuring the grass doesn’t disrupt your shot.
- A steeper swing path and a slightly open clubface help achieve clean, solid strikes while compensating for the rough’s challenges.

**Summary of Adjustments:**
- Grip the club slightly open.
- Move the ball back in your stance.
- Stand closer to the ball.
- Grip down slightly.
- Distribute weight forward.
- Choose one club more than usual.
- Focus on an outside swing path.

By following these steps, you’ll improve your ability to handle shots from the rough and achieve the distance and accuracy you need.
