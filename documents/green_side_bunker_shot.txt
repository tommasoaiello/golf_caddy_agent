How to Play Two Types of Bunker Shots

When faced with bunker shots, choosing the right technique can greatly improve your chances of getting the ball close to the pin. Here are two effective options you can use depending on the situation: a high, flighted shot and a lower shot that releases toward the pin.

1. High, Flighted Bunker Shot
This shot lands softly and stops quickly near the pin. To execute it effectively:

- Ball Position:
Place the ball further forward in your stance, near your left heel. To practice, draw a line in the bunker to mark this position.

- Lower Hands:
Set your hands lower at address. This helps increase loft and gets the ball in the air more easily.

- Match Shaft Angle:
Align the club shaft with the line from the ball to your left heel. This ensures you're using the full loft of the club at impact. Avoid shaft lean, which can reduce loft and cause poor contact.

- Swing and Contact:
Focus on returning the club to its setup position at impact, maintaining the loft for a high, soft shot.

2. Lower-Flighted, Releasing Bunker Shot
This shot requires less effort and is ideal when you want the ball to release and roll toward the pin.

- Ball Position:
Place the ball in the middle or slightly forward of the middle of your stance. Use a line in the sand as a guide during practice.

- Neutral Clubface:
Keep the clubface more neutral (less open) compared to the high shot. This creates less loft and encourages more roll.

- Hand Position:
Keep your hands slightly higher than with the high shot, maintaining a neutral shaft position.

- Swing and Contact:
Focus on striking the sand about 2 inches behind the ball. Use a smaller swing, allowing the ball to release and roll out toward the hole.
